# check_emails

This is a simple python script to help those that need to check blocked email sender lists manually.
The idea is to check which emails can be removed from your block lists by checking if the domain is still capable of sending emails.
The script ingests a list of email addresses and tests it domain for an MX record.

The ouput is a list for futher checking of possible no longer active email addresses.
